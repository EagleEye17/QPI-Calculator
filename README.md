# QPI-Calculator
This is a QPI Calculator made using Python with tkinter as its UI

The calculator can be used if the grading system uses the <i>Ateneo Grading System</i>. Where a QPI rating of 4.0 is the highest and a QPI of 0.0 is the lowest.

The project was inspired by the Computer Society of Ateneo's [QPI Calculator](https://qpi.compsat.org/) from Ateneo de Manila University due to the need for an offline solution.
